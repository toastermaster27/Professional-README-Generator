  ## [Description]

  Creates an easy and efficient way to create a README for any project.

  ## [Purpose]

  This application was created to save time on creating README files for projects, which can sometimes take a substantial amount of time.

  ## [What I Learned]

  I learned how to create a README file using JavaScript and inquirer during this project. I also learned how to create questions in the terminal which will reflect in a file that is auto-generated.


  ## [Installation]

  Download source code and run node index in terminal to use application.


  ## [Usage]

  This project can be used to allocate more time towards working on the project at hand instead of spending unnecessary time typing up a README file.
